# This is the Roadmap for development. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for whatever contribution to one of these features! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Next Features
To contribute for the next featues, fork the repo and open a pull request regarding the [kanban board](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-nodejs/projects/1?fullscreen=true) progress issues or to do. 

> The actual goal is to have **the first release (0.0.2)** with these basic features:

* Blueprint to generate monolitich app with NestJS basic template including, optionally, angular client
* Swagger support
* Entity ORM generation for only a database type and in development
* Preserve liquibase db script orchestration
* Basic security
* Maven simple orchestration to run server and/or client part 

> Let it free to give advices or tips!

## Feature one - DONE
The blueprint must add nodejs framework only if you choose a **monolithic application** (and after baseName question).
So only in this case there will the custom questions.

> In the other all case (**not monolitich application** choosing, the generator run an error and stop the prompting)


## Feature two - DONE
When you choose monolitich application and nodejs framework, the generator will ask:

* A question for the server package manager type (npm or yarn)
* A question for the base name node app
* A question for the jhipster client framework (angular or react)
* A question for the server port for NestJS node app

So, the generation for now must still follow the jhipster standard with these default values for the other features:


```
		packageName com.example.node,
		cacheProvider no,
		enableHibernateCache false,
		authenticationType session,
		devDatabaseType mongodb,
		prodDatabaseType mongodb,
		buildTool maven,
		serviceDiscoveryType false,
		testFrameworks[cucumber],
		clientPackageManager yarn,
		useSass true,
		skipUserManagement false
```

As you can see you have to modify only the server generator (i18n and the other for now must be unchanged).
