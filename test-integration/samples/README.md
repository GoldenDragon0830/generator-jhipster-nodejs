# Sample application generation

To generate test applications, either automatically by the CI or locally on the developer machine, a number of pre-defined configurations have been prepared.

## Application configurations

Those are described in `.yo-rc.json` files which is the descriptor file created by Yeoman to keep track of the choices selected while generating an application.

-   monolith-angular-jwt-dev
-   monolith-react-oauth2-dev

Instead, `-jdl` suffix folders contain `.jdl` files which is the model to create full app and entities:

-   monolith-react-jwt-sql-jdl
-   microservice-oauth2-sql-jdl
